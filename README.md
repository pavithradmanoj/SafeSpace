### Project Description
SafeSpace transforms silent civic frustration into collective action by giving every citizen a safe voice to report issues, amplify urgent concerns through community support, and drive transparent resolution from authorities.

### The Problem statement
Urban cities like Kochi face thousands of unresolved civic issues daily — potholes, broken streetlights, garbage dumps, and safety hazards — simply because there is no simple, direct way for citizens to report them to the right authority. The existing process is bureaucratic, time-consuming, and discouraging, causing most people to stay silent. Meanwhile, authorities have no structured system to receive and prioritize complaints from the public, leaving critical issues unaddressed for months. SafeSpace solves this by providing a two-sided platform where citizens can report issues anonymously in seconds and route them directly to the responsible authority, while authorities get a clean dashboard to manage, filter, and resolve complaints efficiently.

### The Solution
SafeSpace is a two-sided civic reporting platform where citizens anonymously report local issues in seconds — with photo, location, and category — routed directly to the responsible authority. Authorities receive a structured dashboard to filter, search, and resolve complaints efficiently, closing the loop between the public and the people who can act.

# SafeSpace System Architecture

## Components
**5-Layer Structure:**
- **User Layer:** Citizens (report issues) + Authorities (manage reports)
- **Frontend Layer:** `index.html` (structure), `style.css` (styling), `app.js` (logic)
- **Logic Layer:** State management (JS array), Navigation (CSS classes), Filters (real-time search), Form processor (submissions + photo base64)
- **Browser APIs:** FileReader (photo conversion), Intersection Observer (scroll animations), Clipboard API (copy text)
- **Output Layer:** Citizen Portal, Authority Portal, Stats Dashboard, Landing Page

## Data Flow
Load → Initialize seed reports → Citizen submits form → Photo converts to base64 → New report pushed to array → UI re-renders → Authority filters/searches → Marks resolved → Array updates → UI refreshes instantly

## Tech Stack
- HTML loads CSS (link) + JS (script)
- CSS defines variables, styles, `.fade-section`/`.visible` for animations
- JS manipulates DOM (`getElementById`, `innerHTML`), applies dynamic inline styles, calls Browser APIs
- Google Fonts via CDN
- **100% client-side** — no server, no database, no build tools
